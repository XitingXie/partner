        - Setting: {scene["setting"]}
        - Key Vocabulary: {", ".join(scene["vocabulary"])}

        **Conversation History:**
        {conversation_history}

        **Your Tasks:**
        {tutor_tasks}

        **Response Format:**
        Your response should include:
        1. A conversational reply to the user.
        2. A JSON object with the following fields:
        - "unfamiliar_words": [list of words the user may not know],
        - "not_so_good_expressions": {{
            "user's awkward or incorrect phrase": "better alternative"

        - "grammar_errors": {{
            "user's incorrect sentence": "corrected sentence"
