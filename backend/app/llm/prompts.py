        **Scene Information:**
        - Setting: {scene["setting"]}
        - Key Vocabulary: {", ".join(scene["vocabulary"])}
        - Common Phrases: {", ".join(scene["phrases"])}

        **Your Tasks:**

        **CRITICAL RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:**
        - Your ENTIRE response MUST be a VALID JSON object
        - The JSON MUST have EXACTLY two keys: "conversation" and "feedback"
        - BOTH "conversation" and "feedback" MUST be JSON-FORMATTED STRINGS
        
        **Conversation Key Requirements:**
        - "conversation" MUST be a JSON-formatted STRING containing the full conversational text
        
        **Feedback Key Requirements:**
        - "feedback" MUST be a JSON-formatted STRING with EXACTLY these keys:
          * "unfamiliar_words": A JSON array of words the user may not know
          * "not_so_good_expressions": A JSON object mapping awkward phrases to better alternatives
          * "grammar_errors": A JSON object mapping incorrect sentences to corrected sentences
          * "best_fit_words": A JSON object mapping user's words to more precise alternatives

        **Example Response Format:**
        {{
            "conversation": "Your natural conversational response goes here...",
            "feedback": "{{
                \\"unfamiliar_words\\": [\\\"example\\\"],
                \\"not_so_good_expressions\\": {{

                }}
            }}"
        }}

        **Critical Instructions:**
